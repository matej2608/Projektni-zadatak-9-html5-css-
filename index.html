            <h1>3. Powers and duties</h1>
            <p>The referee:
              enforces the Laws of the Game
              controls the match in cooperation with the other match officials
              acts as timekeeper, keeps a record of the match and provides the appropriate authorities with a match report, including information on disciplinary action and any other incidents that occurred before, during or after the match
              supervises and/or indicates the restart of play
              ADVANTAGE
              allows play to continue when an offence occurs and the non-offending team will benefit from the advantage and penalises the offence if the anticipated advantage does not ensue at that time or within a few seconds</p>

            <h1>4. Video assistant referee (VAR)</h1>
            <p>The use of video assistant referees (VARs) is only permitted where the match/competition organiser has fulfilled all Implementation Assistance and Approval Programme (IAAP) requirements as set out in FIFA's IAAP documents, and has received written permission from FIFA.
              The referee may be assisted by a video assistant referee (VAR) only in the event of a 'clear and obvious error' or 'serious missed incident' in relation to:
              goal/no goal
              penalty/no penalty
              direct red card (not second caution)
              The assistance from the video assistant referee (VAR) will relate to using replay(s) of the incident. The referee will make the final decision which may be based solely on the information from the VAR and/or the referee reviewing the replay footage directly ('on-field review').</p>
